Follow the steps below to start the project:
 - Download Expo Client (ios) / Expo (android) on your mobile device 

 In terminal
 - npm install expo-cli --global
 - cd GetSchooled/
 - yarn
 - expo start

 Instructions:
    On the home page, the user can choose to add or review notecards
    If the user chooses to add notecards, they will be taken to a screen where they can specify front and back for each card. This is helpful when practicing with terms and definitions.
    If the user chooses to review, they will be taken to a card with just the front displayed. The card can be tapped on to reveal the back/the definition. They can record whether they got the definition correct or not on the bottom, which will take them to the next card (currently hard coded).
    At any time, the user can return to the home screen with the tap of the button at the top.
